# ðŸš€ NovaLink â€“ Earth to Mars Communication Simulator

NovaLink is an interactive **React + Node.js** web application that simulates the communication delay between Earth and Mars.  
Users can send messages and watch them appear after a calculated time delay, representing the actual lag in interplanetary communication.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview
- **Communication Delay Simulation** â€“ Message appearance is delayed using time calculations based on the average Earthâ€“Mars distance.
- **Messaging Interface** â€“ Users can type and send messages just like a chat, but with the realistic delay applied.
- **Educational Experience** â€“ Helps users understand the impact of space distances on communication.
