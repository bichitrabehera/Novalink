            Why I Built This
          </h2>
          <p>
            I built this website to simulate how communication between Earth and
            Mars works. In real space missions, sending messages isn't
            instantaneous â€” it takes time due to the vast distance between the
            planets. Through this project, you can experience the challenges of
            communication across millions of kilometers in space.

            About Earth, Mars, and Space
          </h2>
          <p>
            Earth is our home planet, full of oceans, forests, and life. It
            orbits at an average distance of approximately 149.6 million
            kilometers from the Sun.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mars, often referred to as the "Red Planet," is located at an
            average distance of 227.9 million kilometers from the Sun. It is a
            cold, arid planet with the potential to have supported life in the
            past.
          </p>
          <p>
            The vastness of space, the nearly empty region between celestial
            bodies, makes the time taken for communication even more
            significant. Space is silent, mysterious, and seemingly infinite,
            and it provides a backdrop to every message sent across it.

            Message Delay Time
          </h2>
          <p>
            When Earth and Mars are closest (about 56 million kilometers apart),
            a message takes approximately 3 minutes to travel one-way.
          </p>
          <p>
            At their farthest (about 401 million kilometers apart), the delay
            can exceed 22 minutes for a one-way message.
          </p>
          <p>
            A simple "Hello" from Earth to Mars and back can take as long as 44
            minutes when the planets are at their most distant.

            The Goal
          </h2>
          <p>
            This project serves as a tribute to the patience, wonder, and
            engineering required for interplanetary communication. Whether you
            are on Earth or Mars, every message is significant and requires a
            reminder of how vast the universe truly is.
